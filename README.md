I started by reading through the documentation on https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/ and then went about retrieving the JSON using jQuery.

Next I added some simple validation so that if the user enters a location that is not valid or searches using an empty string they would get a relevant message informing them of an error.

I then used some scss to style the page very basically and decided that I would use the recommended search so switched from the venue search to the explore endpoint.

Finally, I added the bootstrap and added some more content to the search results along with some more styling.

I did take a break between the previous commit and final commits. Total time including research was around 3 hrs 15mins.
